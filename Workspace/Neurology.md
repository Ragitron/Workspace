>	- D. Weakness of lateral movement of the right eye  
>	- E. Weakness of the left orbicularis oculi muscle
^question5

> [!C: Constricted right pupil]
> Horner syndrome results from interruption of the sympathetic supply to the head and is characterised by enophthalmos, miosis, ptosis, and a warm dry skin (anhydrosis) on the affected side of the face. The loss of sympathetic tone causes vasodilatation of the cutaneous vessels of the cheek and nasal mucosa with absence of sweating and a feeling of nasal obstruction. There is also a narrowing of the palpebral fissure where the ptosis is due to weakness of the superior tarsal muscle or Muller's muscle. There is also a contraction of the pupil due a unopposed action of the autonomic parasympathetic inflow via the occulomotor nerve. The movement of the eyeball is unaffected. 
> The sympathetic pathway may be interrupted in the cervical spinal cord, from  the sympathetic trunk, the brachial plexus, over the lung apex in the superior cervical ganglion, within the adventitia of the internal carotid artery or through  the cavernous sinus. Conditions that can produce a Horner syndrome include  anything that might destroy the cervical sympathetic chain, such as invading  malignancy at the lung apex. Brainstem stroke can also cause Horner syndrome  and other neurological symptoms may then co-exist such as diplopia, vertigo and ataxia, whilst the presence of neck pain should point towards the possibility of a carotid dissection.

> A 49-year-old man presents with sudden onset of left facial weakness. He experienced a respiratory infection 2 weeks ago and has had a dull ache behind the left ear for 2 days. This morning while shaving, he noticed a drooping of the left side of his face. Examination reveals complete paralysis of the left upper face and forehead. Hearing, taste and sensation are normal, and the other cranial nerves are functioning normally. No rash or vesicles are noted. Which one of the following clinical features would suggest a poorer prognosis and prompt early treatment%% with prednisolone%%?  
> 	- A. Abrupt onset of symptoms  
> 	- B. Age younger than 60 years  
> 	- C. Complete paralysis  
> 	- D. Previous similar episode  
> 	- E. Recent respiratory infection
^question12

> [!C: complete paralysis]
> This patient has an acute, idiopathic, facial neuropathy (Bell's Palsy). The abrupt onset of unilateral facial weakness with lower motor neurone (forehead) involve- ment preceded by pain behind the ear is classical. Over 80% of patients eventually make a full recovery. Early treatment with prednisolone significantly improves the chances of complete recovery at 3 and 9 months and is appropriate for patients with clinical features indicating a poorer prognosis. Such features include severe (complete) paralysis, older age, hyperacusis, altered taste and electromyographic evidence of axonal degeneration. Recent evidence implicates herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 infection in many patients. Trials of facial nerve decompression have not demonstrated efficacy (Gilden, 2004: Gilden and Tyler, 2007).

> 	- B. Trigeminal neuralgia  
> 	- C. Acute closed angle glaucoma  
> 	- D. Cluster headache  
> 	- E. Temporal arteritis
^question15

> [!D: cluster headache]
> Cluster headache is an extremely painful and distressing. Attacks are unilateral, generally last 15 minutes to 3 hours and have a characteristic set of ipsilateral cranial autonomic feature (lacrimation, nasal congestion or rhinorrhoea, ptosis, oedema of the eyelid or the face, sweating of the forehead or the face, and miosis), which are often accompanied by agitation. Attacks occur from once every other day to eight times daily, in bouts that last several weeks, usually with complete remission between bouts. 
> Acute attacks should be treated with high flow oxygen and/or parenteral triptans. Verapamil can be helpful as prophylactic treatment. There is a marked male predominance, an association with smoking and in many people a precipitation by alcohol and occurrence durting the night.
> Attacks of migraine tend to be less severe and to last longer; cranial autonomic features are unusual, whilst nausea, vomiting, and bilateral photophobia are more common. Migraine lacks the striking clustering of attacks and most patietns prefer not to move during a migrainous episode, in contrast to the agitation and restlessness experienced by many patients during a cluster attack.
> Trigeminal neuralgia tends to affect people over  50 years and consists of sudden, short stabs of pain, affecting the second and third divisions of the trigemnial nerve. It is not associated with cranial autonomic features. Acute glaucoma might mimic, but is is not usually associated with, the clustering pattern, recurrence or precipitation by alcohol. Temporal arteritis affects an older population and the headaches are usually not so severe or clustering in pattern.

> 	- C. Parkinson disease  
> 	- D. Progressive supranuclear palsy  
> 	- E. Primary adrenal insufficiency
^question20

> [!B: multiple system atrophy]
> Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a degenerative neurological disorder (Stefanova et al., 2009). The cause of MSA is unknown and no specific risk factors have been identified. The aggregation, deposition and dysfunction of alpha-synuclein (aSyn) in Lewy bodies and glial cytoplasmic iriclusions are common events in neurode-generative disorders known as synucleinopathies, which include Parkinson disease, dementia with Lewy bodies and multiple system atrophy. Approximately 55%  of cases of MSA occur in men, with the typical age of onset in the 50s to 60s.  
> Patients with MSA present with a heterogeneous combination of autonomic failure, urogenital dysfunction, cerebellar ataxia, parkinsonian, and pyramidal signs. The diagnosis of probable MSA requires the presence of urinary dysfunction or orthostatic hypotension with a decrease in blood pressure of at least 30 mmHg  systolic and 15 mmHg diastolic within 3 min after standing up, as well as a motor syndrome that includes parkinsonism with a poor response to levodopa or a cerebellar syndrome. Use of bladder function assessment often detects early abnormalities consistent with neurogenic disturbance with detrusor hyper-reflexia and abnormal urethral sphincter function followed later in disease progression by increased residual urine volume. Cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction in MSA can be investigated with a standing blood pressure test.

> A 65-year-old woman who is known to have myasthenia gravis for the past 4 years had been started on oral antibiotics for an upper respiratory tract infection. Two days later she is brought to hospital with confusion and arterial blood gases reveal an elevated partial arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 55 mmHg (37- 45mmHg). What is the most appropriate treatment for her presentation? 
> 	- A. Combination of high-dose prednisolone and azathioprine 
> 	- B. Plasmapheresis  
> 	- C. Intravenous pyridostigmine 
> 	- D. Urgent thymectomy 
> 	- E. Intravenous antibiotics
^question21

> [!B: plasmapheresis]
> This patient has myasthenic crisis and should receive urgent ventilatory support  that could include intubation and ventilation. The myasthenia gravis should be  urgently treated with plasmapheresis (Chaudhuri and Behan, 2009). Myasthenic  crisis is a life-threatening medical emergency requiring early diagnosis and respiratory assistance. It can affect between one-fifth and one-third of all patients with myasthenia gravis.  
> Myasthenic crisis is caused by severe weakness of the respiratory muscles, upper airway muscles (bulbar myasthenia) or both. It is typically precipitated by poor control of generalised disease, medical treatment for bulbar myasthenia (steroids and anti-cholinesterases); concomitant use of certain antibiotics (aminoglycosiae quinolones and macrolides), muscle relaxants, benzodiazepines, beta-blockers and iodinated radiocontrast agents. Patients must be offered elective ventilation on a clinical diagnosis without waiting for blood gas changes to show hypoxaemia.  
> Careful observation and bedside measurements (vital capacity, peak flow measurement, pulse rate, and blood pressure) are more important than repeated monitoring of blood gases.  
> 
> Both plasma exchange and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) are comparable in terms of treatment efficacy. There is no significant advantage of an initial pulse of intravenous methylprednisolone over regular prednisolone, which is given by nasogastric tube at a pharmacological dose (1 mg/kg) and must be  several months after recovery from the crisis until alternative immunosuppressive or steroid-sparing agents (such as azathioprine or ciclosporin) become effective.
> Intravenous pyridostigmine in a patient with myasthenic crisis is controversial as it can cause coronary vasospasm leading to myocardial infarction. Besides, large doses of anti-cholinesterases promote excessive salivary and gastric secretions, which may increase the risk of aspiration pneumonia.

> 	- B. Blood glucose  
> 	- C. Synacthen tes?  
> 	- D. Electromyography
> 	- E. Testing for acetylcholine receptor antibodies
^question25

>[!A: assessment of serum potassium level]
> Hyperkalaemic and hypokalaemic periodic paralysis are both characterised by an abnormal serum potassium level at the time of symptom occurrence. However, potassium level can be normal between attacks, and thus, measurement of serum potassium during symptoms is the most important next step to take in assessing and treating this patient. Hyperkalaemic periodic paralysis is caused by a defect of a sodium channel (ScN4A), precipitated by rest folloring exercise, stress, potassium administration, and the ingesting of certain foods. Hypokalaemic periodic paralysis is caused by a defect in a calcium channel (CACNL1A3) and is precipitated by the partaking of meals high in carbohydrates, rest following exercise, and excitement. If the potassium level is found to be low during attacks, secondary causes of hypokalaemia (diuretics, hyperaldosteronism, laxatives, etc) or thyrotoxicosis (especially in patients of Asian descent) should be sough. A serum potassium level that is elevated without apparent cause is suggestive of hyperkalaemic periodic paralysis.
